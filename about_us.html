            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Golden Grass Valley, a haven where nature's simplicity meets our passion for goat farming. Our journey began in 2020, born from a dream to create a place where goats can thrive in their natural habitat while contributing to sustainable agriculture. Our founder, Muhammad Masood, started this venture with a vision to revolutionize traditional goat farming methods, prioritizing animal welfare and environmental sustainability.</p>
